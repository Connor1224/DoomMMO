Content     :   Implementation of AS StringManager and builtins.
Created     :   March, 2010
Authors     :   Michael Antonov

Notes       :   This built-in StringManager is separated from the one
                used by AS2, but they can share a common
                ASStringManager instance.

/* ***** AS3 String Builtin Notes

Built-ins are strings that can be accessed very efficiently based on
a constant. They are usually obtained from the built-in manager through
an inline function such as

// Returns a string for "undefined"
pManager->GetBuiltin(ASBuiltin_undefined)

Builtins are pre-created ahead of time, so that GetBuiltin() can be
inlined to a single array access. Built-in strings are used heavily
throughout AS so performance of their references and compares is of
vital importance.

AS3::StringManager builtins are separate from the ones used in AS2
since there is a smaller number of them needed. For now, we combine
AS3 implementation (Top-Level) and Flash strings here; however,
they shouldn't cause a dependency problem.

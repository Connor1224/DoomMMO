/*! \mainpage APEX Wind Module Description
 * \image html WindIconNoBorder.JPG
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * APEX Wind simulates the various components of wind using force fields.
 * These include the prevailing wind, gusts, and the drag and flutter force fields.
 * Drag and Flutter while not strictly part of wind normally allow objects such as
 * leaves and paper to behave in a manner consistent with light falling objects that flutter
 * as they fall.<br>
 *
 * \section compat_sec PhysX SDK compatibility
 * APEX Wind is compatible with PhysX SDK version 2.8.4 only.<br>
 *
 * \section dependencies_sec APEX Module Dependencies
 * APEX Wind Assets can optionally specify one or more APEX Field Boundary (Force Field module) assets that are
 * attached as exclude groups in every force field created by APEX wind.  If a Field Boundary Asset is specified
 * in an APEX Wind Asset the Force Field Module (which creates the Field Boundary actors) is force loaded.
 * Field Boundary actors that are created at module load time as well as those that are dynimacally created are
 * added to each force field when they are created and are removed when they are released.<br>
 *
 * \section physX_dependencies_sec PhysX Dependencies
 * For an APEX Wind force field to interact with a PhysX actor such as various types of particles, rigid bodies and
 * cloth the actors and the force field have to be in the same PhysX collision group.  APEX modules set their
 * collision group symbolically.  The actual collision group used is looked up in the Named Resource Provider (NRP).
 * For APEX Wind and PhysX particles to interact in the desired manner manner (I.E. look "real") many particle
 * parameters must be set proportionally to the APEX Wind forces such as the particle mass, the coefficient of
 * static friction (stiction) and particle parameters such as the Motion Limit Multiplier.  If these parameters
 * are not balanced the wind could be blowing but nothing could move or at the other extreme the wind could blow
 * and every actor is blown far away in a single frame.  Due to the time required to tune these parameters it is
 * recommended that assets be derived from working samples and then tuned to achieve the desired behavior.<br>

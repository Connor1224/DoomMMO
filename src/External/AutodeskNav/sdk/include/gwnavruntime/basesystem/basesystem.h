/// The BaseSystemConfig class contains a set of objects and configuration parameters that are required in order
/// to initialize the BaseSystem. The information maintained by the BaseSystemConfig determines how the BaseSystem
/// carries out basic operations common to many Gameware Navigation runtime components, such as allocating memory,
/// logging messages, etc.
/// When you initialize Gameware Navigation for use in your game, you typically create an instance of BaseSystemConfig
/// on the stack, and customize the behavior of the subsystems managed by the BaseSystem by modifying the class
/// members of the BaseSystemConfig.
/// Depending on the kind of sub-system you intend to customize, you may have to write your own derivation of a class
/// supplied in the SDK, create a new instance of your class on the heap, and/or set the relevant member of the
/// BaseSystemConfig to point to your new object. NOTE: the BaseSystem does not assume the responsibility for
/// the lifespan of the object. You must ensure the pointer remains valid until the BaseSystem is terminated, and
/// you must destroy the object after it is no longer needed.
/// For example, to customize the message logging system, you need to write your own implementation of the BaseLog class,
/// create an instance of your class, and set the #m_log member to point to your new instance.
/// When you have set up the BaseSystemConfig with all the customizations that you need, pass it in a call to
/// the BaseSystem::Init() method.
/// Once the BaseSystem has been successfully initialized, you can destroy the BaseSystemConfig or let it pass out of
/// scope.

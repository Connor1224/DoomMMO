	/// starting position-in both directions orthogonally-to BaseDiskCastQuery::m_normalizedDir2d. Each raycast has a length
	/// equal to BaseDiskCastQuery::m_radius. Positions of the raycast collisions are moved back very slightly from the NavMesh boundary, and the resulting positions
	/// are used as the extent of the disk. This results in a disk that is smaller than the one set in BaseDiskCastQuery::m_radius, but whose extents are guaranteed
	/// to be fully inside the NavMesh at its starting point.
